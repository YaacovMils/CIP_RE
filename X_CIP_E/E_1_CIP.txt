@purpose
This program (`E_1_CIP.txt`) is the master organizational routine for the "CIP E" process. It is a high-level container, similar in function to `D_CIP.txt`, that does not contain any direct control logic itself. Its sole responsibility is to call all the sub-programs that constitute the CIP E control system in a specific, deterministic order during each PLC scan.

This structured execution is essential for the stability and predictability of the CIP E sequence.

The execution order is as follows:
1.  `E_DI()`, `E_AI_AQ()`, `E_DQ()`: Handles all I/O processing for Line E.
2.  `RX_TX_E()`: Manages communication specific to the E-line.
3.  `E_BITAL()`: Decodes the current step number into an active step flag.
4.  `E_ERR()`: Checks for and processes any error or fault conditions for Line E.
5.  `E_GNACT()`: Energizes the physical outputs based on the active step.
6.  `E_OPER()`: Arbitrates between automatic and manual control commands.
7.  `E_STRCT()`: Executes the main sequencer logic that determines when to advance to the next step.
8.  `FQ_E()`: Performs flow rate and totalization calculations for Line E.

@inputs
- This program has no direct inputs; it calls subroutines that interact with global variables.

@outputs
- This program has no direct outputs; it calls subroutines that interact with global variables.

@notes
- This code is for a GE/Emerson RX3i PLC and is written in Structured Text (ST).
- This file is another clear example of the modular and structured programming methodology used in this project. It provides an excellent high-level overview of the entire scan cycle for the CIP E process.
- The deliberate order of execution (I/O -> Logic -> Outputs) is a fundamental best practice for robust PLC programming.

(* This master routine orchestrates the entire CIP E process by calling a series of sub-programs in a specific order. This modular approach separates I/O handling, error checking, sequencing logic, and physical output control into distinct files, making the system easier to manage and troubleshoot. *)
