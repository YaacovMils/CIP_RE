@purpose
This program (`CIP_C.txt`) is the master organizational routine for the Cleaning-In-Place (CIP) C-line process. Following the established pattern of `CIP_A.txt` and `CIP_B.txt`, this program contains no direct process logic. Its sole purpose is to ensure the sub-programs for Line C are executed in the correct, deterministic order during each PLC scan.

The execution sequence is as follows:
1.  `C_CMD()`: The command handler for Line C is called to process any new operator or system commands.
2.  `C_CIP()`: The core process logic for Line C is executed, which controls the valves and pumps based on the commands.
3.  `C_U_ST()`: The status update routine is called to assemble the final status word for HMI/SCADA display.

@inputs
- This program has no direct inputs; it calls subroutines that interact with global variables.

@outputs
- This program has no direct outputs; it calls subroutines that interact with global variables.

@notes
- This code is for a GE/Emerson RX3i PLC and is written in Structured Text (ST).
- This file is another clear example of the templated design approach used in this project, ensuring consistency across the different CIP lines.
- Enforcing the `CMD -> LOGIC -> STATUS` execution order via a master routine like this is a robust design pattern that prevents race conditions and ensures predictable system behavior from one scan to the next.
