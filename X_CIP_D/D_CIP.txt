@purpose
This program (`D_CIP.txt`) serves as the master organizational routine for the entire "CIP D" process. It is a high-level container that does not contain any direct control logic itself. Instead, its sole responsibility is to call all the necessary sub-programs that make up the Line D control system in a specific, deterministic order.

This structured approach is crucial for the stable and predictable operation of the complex Line D sequence.

The execution order is as follows:
1.  `D_AI()`, `D_AQ()`, `D_DI()`, `D_DQ()`: Handles all I/O processing first – reading and scaling inputs, preparing and scaling outputs.
2.  `D_ERROR()`: Checks for and processes any error or fault conditions.
3.  `D_STRCT()`: Executes the main sequencer logic that determines if the process should advance to the next step.
4.  `D_GNACT()`: Based on the current step, this program energizes the required physical outputs (pumps, valves).
5.  `TX_COMM()`, `RX_COMM()`: Manages EGD or other forms of communication with external systems.
6.  `FQ()`: Performs flow rate and totalization calculations.
7.  `D_OPER()`: Handles operator commands and status updates for the HMI.

@inputs
- This program has no direct inputs; it calls subroutines that interact with global variables.

@outputs
- This program has no direct outputs; it calls subroutines that interact with global variables.

@notes
- This code is for a GE/Emerson RX3i PLC and is written in Structured Text (ST).
- This file is an excellent example of a structured, modular programming approach in a PLC environment. It acts as the "main" function for the entire Line D process, providing a clear and easy-to-follow overview of the program's scan cycle.
- The order of execution is deliberate, ensuring that inputs are read before logic is executed, and logic is executed before outputs are written, which is a fundamental principle of robust PLC programming.

This modular approach separates I/O handling, error checking, sequencing logic, and physical output control into distinct files, making the system easier to manage and troubleshoot. *)
