@purpose
This program (`DO_TANK.txt`, short for "Digital Output Tank" or "Do Tank Logic") is a master organizational routine that groups and executes all the sub-programs related to the CIP supply tanks. It does not contain any process logic itself but serves to structure the execution of the tank farm control logic.

Its sole function is to call the individual tank control and monitoring programs in a fixed, deterministic order during each PLC scan cycle.

The execution sequence is:
1.  `LVL_DLY()`: A utility that likely handles time delays for level alarms to prevent nuisance trips from splashing.
2.  `T1_WTR()`: The main logic for the Fresh Water Tank (Tank 1).
3.  `T2_RWTR()`: The main logic for the Recovery Water Tank (Tank 2).
4.  `T3_ACID()`: The main logic for the Acid Tank (Tank 3).
5.  `T45SODA()`: The main logic for the Soda Tanks (Tanks 4 and 5).

@inputs
- This program has no direct inputs; it calls subroutines that interact with global variables.

@outputs
- This program has no direct outputs; it calls subroutines that interact with global variables.

@notes
- This code is for a GE/Emerson RX3i PLC and is written in Structured Text (ST).
- This program is a key example of the structured, modular design of the PLC codebase. Grouping related subroutines under a single master call (`_Main.txt` calls `DO_TNK`, which then calls the individual tank programs) makes the overall program flow much easier to follow and maintain.
