(*
* @purpose: Handles specific HMI commands related to the "B" CIP unit.
*           This program interprets commands from the MMI to stop the "B"
*           unit's automatic sequence and to reset its associated alarms.
* @platform: GE/Emerson RX3i PLC
* @language: Structured Text (ST)
*
* @inputs:
*   R00536[62] (INT) (aliased as MMICMD): The command code received from the HMI.
*     - Command `36`: Stop Batch Mode.
*     - Commands `38`, `39`: Reset Alarms.
*
* @outputs:
*   B_ALARM (%M00171) (BOOL): Resets the general alarm for the "B" unit.
*   BMMISTP (%M00153) (BOOL): Sets a flag to stop the "B" unit's automatic sequence.
*
* @notes: This program is called by MMI0CMD.txt whenever a new command is detected. It only acts on
*         commands relevant to the "B" unit.
