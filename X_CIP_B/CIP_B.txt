@purpose
This program (`CIP_B.txt`) serves as a master organizational routine for the entire Cleaning-In-Place (CIP) B-line process. It is a direct parallel to `CIP_A.txt` and contains no direct process logic itself. Its sole function is to call the main sub-programs for Line B in the correct and deterministic sequence.

The execution order is critical for stable operation:
1.  `B_CMD()`: The command handler is called first to interpret any new commands for Line B.
2.  `B_CIP()`: Next, the main process logic is executed, acting upon the flags set by `B_CMD`.
3.  `B_U_ST()`: Finally, the status update routine is called to compile the final status word for HMI/SCADA communication.

@inputs
- This program has no direct inputs; it calls subroutines that interact with global variables.

@outputs
- This program has no direct outputs; it calls subroutines that interact with global variables.

@notes
- This code is for a GE/Emerson RX3i PLC and is written in Structured Text (ST).
- This file demonstrates the templated, copy-paste design pattern used in this project, as it is functionally identical to `CIP_A.txt` but scoped to the "B" set of variables and programs.
- Using this type of organizational block is excellent programming practice for complex PLC applications as it guarantees a predictable scan cycle.
