@purpose
This program (`B_U_ST.txt`) is responsible for creating a comprehensive status word for the Cleaning-In-Place (CIP) B-line process. It is a direct functional equivalent of `A_U_ST.txt`. The program aggregates numerous individual boolean status flags into a single integer variable (`B_STAT`) for efficient communication with external systems like an HMI or SCADA.

The program constructs the status word by:
1.  Assigning a base value to indicate the current active stage (1 for Stage 1, 2 for Stage 2, 3 for Stage 3).
2.  Setting specific bits within the integer to represent various states (e.g., Stopped, Alarm, Ended, Ready).
3.  Adding the current reactor number (`B_REAC_num_`) to the final value, embedding the target vessel information directly into the status word.

@inputs
- `B1_STRT` (BOOL), `B2_STRT` (BOOL), `B3_STRT` (BOOL): Boolean flags indicating the currently active CIP stage for Line B.
- `B_STOP` (BOOL): Flag indicating the Line B process is stopped.
- `B_ALARM` (BOOL): Flag indicating an alarm condition on Line B.
- `B_END` (BOOL): Flag indicating the Line B process has completed.
- `B_FILLS` (BOOL), `B_FULL` (BOOL): Flags related to the filling status of the reactor on Line B.
- `B_REAC_num_` (INT): The number of the reactor currently being serviced by CIP B.

@outputs
- `B_STAT` (%R09048) (INT): The final, consolidated status integer. Its value is interpreted as follows:
    - **Lower 4 bits (0-15):** Represent the active stage (1, 2, or 3).
    - **Bit 5 (Value 16):** Set if `B_STOP` is TRUE.
    - **Bit 6 (Value 32):** Set if `B_END` is TRUE.
    - **Bit 7 (Value 64):** Set if the system is idle/ready.
    - **Bit 8 (Value 128):** Set if `B_ALARM` is TRUE.
    - **Higher bits:** The reactor number is added to this base value.

@notes
- This code is for a GE/Emerson RX3i PLC and is written in Structured Text (ST).
- The near-identical structure of this file compared to `A_U_ST.txt` confirms a templated or copy-paste approach was used for developing logic for the different CIP lines.
- This program provides an efficient, single-register summary of the entire state of the CIP B line, which is ideal for SCADA/HMI communication.
